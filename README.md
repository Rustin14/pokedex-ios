- **Combine** - Reactive programming framework for handling asynchronous data flows
- **CoreData** - Local data persistence and management
- **CoreAnimation** - Smooth animations and visual effects

### Networking & Data
- **Alamofire** - HTTP networking for initial data fetching and updates
- **JSON Decoding** - Native Swift JSON parsing for Pok√©mon data

### Additional Features

- **Search & Filter** - Quick Pok√©mon discovery functionality

## üì± Screenshots

*Coming soon - Screenshots will be added as development progresses*

## üéØ Requirements

- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 14.0+
- Swift 5.7+

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rustin14/pokedex-ios.git
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
```bash
cd pokedex-ios
open PokeDex.xcodeproj
```

3. Build and run the project (‚åò + R)

## üìä Data Source

This app utilizes Pok√©mon data from reliable sources to provide accurate and up-to-date information about:
- Basic Pok√©mon stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.)
- Evolution chains
- Pok√©dex entries and descriptions
- Sprite images and artwork

## üèó Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern:

- **Models**: CoreData entities and Pok√©mon data structures
- **Views**: SwiftUI views for different screens
- **ViewModels**: Combine-powered reactive data handling
- **Services**: Alamofire-based networking and CoreData management

## üé® Key Components

### Data Layer
- **CoreData Stack**: Persistent storage for offline functionality
- **Network Service**: Alamofire-based API communication
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean abstraction for data access

### UI Layer
- **Custom SwiftUI Views**: Reusable components for Pok√©mon cards, stats, etc.
- **CoreAnimation Integration**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all iOS device sizes

### Reactive Programming
- **Combine Publishers**: Reactive data streams
- **Property Wrappers**: @StateObject, @ObservedObject for SwiftUI integration
- **Async/Await**: Modern concurrency for network operations
